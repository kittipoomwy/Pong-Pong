This is my very First Game - Pong Pong 

This is my first game project created in Unity as a part of my learning journey into game development. It is a classic 2D Pong-style game where two players compete by bouncing a ball back and forth. The goal is to score points by making the opponent miss the ball.

## Features
- **2-Player Gameplay**: Play with a friend locally.
- **Classic Pong Mechanics**: Control paddles to bounce the ball.

## Tools Used
- **Unity**: Used to create the game.
- **C#**: For game logic and mechanics.
- **TextMeshPro**: For rendering UI text like scores and menus.
- **Piskel**: For drawing all in game.

## How to Play
1. **Player 1 Controls**:
   - Move Up: `W`
   - Move Down: `S`
2. **Player 2 Controls**:
   - Move Up: `Up Arrow`
   - Move Down: `Down Arrow`
3. **Pause the Game**: Press `Escape`
4. The ball starts in the middle and moves toward a random direction. Players must hit the ball to prevent it from going off-screen on their side.
5. The first player to reach 5 points wins!
